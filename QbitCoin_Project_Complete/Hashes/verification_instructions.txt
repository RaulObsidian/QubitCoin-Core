Instructions for verifying hashes and timestamping.

1) To compute SHA-256 locally:
   sha256sum Whitepaper_Tecnico_Bilingue.pdf

2) To timestamp on Bitcoin (OP_RETURN) or Ethereum:
   - You can use third-party services (proof-of-existence.org) or send a small tx with OP_RETURN containing the hash.
   - Alternatively, ask a notary service.
