QbitCoin (QBC): The First PostQuantum Financial Infrastructure
The End of Classical Cryptography and the Birth of Absolute Mathematical Security
The world is inexorably approaching the "Q-Day": the event horizon at which quantum computers will
crack the RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) encryption that protects % of the world
economy, including Bitcoin.
QbitCoin is not a simple update; it is a mathematical revolution. We are introducing RubikPoW, a new
consensus mechanism based on the theory of non-abelian permutation groups. While Bitcoin relies on
number factorization (vulnerable to Shor's algorithm), QbitCoin is based on the combinatorial
complexity of the "God's Number" in multi-dimensional state spaces.
The Technology: RubikPoW vs. Brute Force
RubikPoW replaces traditional mining by solving combinatorial puzzles in the symmetric group S.

QbitCoin Part II: Deep Engineering
and Quantum Economics -
Introduction
A fundamental reconstruction of cryptographic architecture for the post-quantum era. This
technical document delves into the mathematical, economic, and cryptographic foundations that
position QbitCoin as the security standard for global capital in a world where quantum supremacy
is imminent.
This document is structured into sections covering:
The mathematical foundations that make QbitCoin resistant to quantum attacks
The detailed analysis of quantum threats and how QbitCoin neutralizes them
The decentralized network architecture
The economic mechanisms that guarantee sustainability
The implemented post-quantum cryptography
The auditing and security programs
The long-term vision as a global monetary infrastructure
Mathematical Foundations: The
Superiority of S¤¨ - Part 2
Fundamental Cryptographic Properties:
1
Absolute Entropy
The inherent randomness
in the permutation system
makes brute-force attacks
computationally
impossible, even with
advanced quantum
resources. Each move
introduces non-reversible
entropy.
2
NonCommutativity
Unlike abelian groups, in
 the order of operations
matters: . This
property thwarts linear
algebra-based attacks that
threaten lattice-based
systems.

Exponential
Complexity
Combinatorial group
theory offers a structural
advantage over numerical
problems. While
factorization can be
addressed using quantum
Fourier transforms,
finding the optimal path in
a permutation graph
requires navigating a
combinatorial maze with
no exploitable structure.
There is no known
'quantum shortcut' for
this problem, and
mathematical proofs
suggest none can exist
under the current axioms
of quantum mechanics.
Our RubikPoW protocol transforms each mined block into a mathematical proof that the miner
successfully navigated this combinatorial space. Verification, paradoxically, is instantaneous:
in time complexity. This creates a fundamental asymmetry: difficult to produce, trivial to verify4
the distinctive signature of any robust cryptographic system.
O(1)
"The difference between classical security and quantum security is not a matter of degree, but
of foundation. QbitCoin does not aim to be stronger; it aims to be invulnerable by design."
Mathematical Foundations: The
Superiority of S¤¨ - Part 1
Current cryptography relies on an axiom that is about to
collapse: the computational difficulty of factoring large
prime numbers. This is the pillar upon which RSA was
built, the algorithm that protects trillions of dollars in
global financial infrastructure. However, this paradigm
faces its programmed obsolescence. Quantum
computers, using Shor's algorithm, can factor these
numbers in polynomial time, turning what once required
millions of years into calculations completed in minutes.
QbitCoin represents a radical paradigm shift. Instead of
relying on prime factorization, our architecture is based
on Non-Abelian Permutation Groups, specifically the
symmetric group . This group describes all possible
permutations of  elements, corresponding to the 
movable pieces of a cryptographically modified ×
Rubik's Cube.
S48
The state space of contains approximately unique configurations. To contextualize
this magnitude: there are more possible states in our system than atoms in the observable
universe.

Quantum Resistance: Analysis of
Grover's Algorithm - Part 2
The analysis of QbitCoin's quantum resistance extends beyond mere computational complexity.
Even under the most optimistic assumptions for quantum attackers, the inherent physical
limitations of the universe impose insurmountable barriers.
QUANTUM DECOHERENCE
The previous analysis assumes a perfect quantum computer with infinite coherence, something
quantum decoherence makes impossible. Quantum systems lose their coherent state in
microseconds. Maintaining a stable quantum state for operations would require quantum error
correction on a scale that multiplies the energy cost by additional factors of or more.

ASYMMETRIC DEFENSIVE
ADVANTAGE
While attackers must overcome
fundamental thermodynamic barriers,
defenders only need to verify a
mathematical proof in constant time. This
asymmetry is unprecedented in the
history of cryptography.
TEMPORAL SCALABILITY
Even if quantum technology advances
exponentially, the search space grows
factorially. We can increase the complexity
of the cube (from × to ×) in a soft
fork, multiplying security by factors that
render centuries of quantum progress
obsolete.
Quantum Resistance: Grover's
Algorithm Analysis - Part 1
Grover's Algorithm, introduced by Lov Grover in , represents the most serious theoretical
threat against cryptographic hash functions. Unlike Shor's algorithm, which attacks specific
factorization problems, Grover's is a general-purpose algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup (
) for searches in unstructured spaces. This means that any problem requiring possibilities to
be tested can be solved in approximately quantum steps.
N N
N
For traditional hash functions like SHA-, this implies that effective security is reduced from 
bits to  bits, a significant but not catastrophic degradation. However, when we analyze QbitCoin
under this threat model, the numbers tell a radically different story.
QUANTUM THREAT ANALYSIS:
Classical Search Space
Our state space contains
possible configurations. A classical
computer testing one billion states per
second would require years, exceeding
the age of the universe by an
unimaginable factor.
1.57 × 10116

Grover's Application
A perfect quantum computer applying
Grover's reduces this space to
quantum operations. This sounds
impressive until we consider the physical
limitations.

Node Architecture: Network
Topology - Part 2
PROPAGATION AND CONSENSUS
MECHANISMS:
The architecture allows any user with a smartphone to participate in verification, while only those
with significant resources can mine. This democratizes security without compromising
performance. An attacker would need to control both the majority of the mining hashrate and the
majority of validator nodes, two groups with diverging economic incentives.
1
Gossip Protocol
Transactions are propagated via an epidemic
broadcast protocol. Each node retransmits to
 random peers, ensuring logarithmic
propagation: the entire network in
hops.
k = 8
log (N) 8
2
Partition Resistance
If the network is geographically partitioned
(Sybil attack, state censorship), each
partition continues to operate
independently. Upon reconnection, it is
resolved by the chain with the most
accumulated work, not the longest.
DECENTRALIZED REPUTATION SYSTEM:
Nodes implement a decentralized reputation system based on historical behavior proofs. A node
that propagates invalid blocks or malformed transactions sees its reputation decrease
exponentially, resulting in automatic network isolation without the need for central coordination.
This social immunity mechanism creates a self-healing network that evolves against adaptive
attacks.
"A decentralized network is not one where all nodes are equal, but one where no set of nodes
can dictate consensus unilaterally."
Node Architecture: Network
Topology - Part 1
Decentralization is not an abstract ideological goal; it is an engineering requirement for systemic
survival. A centralized network creates single points of failure that can be attacked, censored, or coopted. QbitCoin implements a multi-level network topology that balances the contradictory
demands of radical decentralization, operational performance, and economic accessibility.

Tokenomics I: Supply and
Programmed Scarcity - Part 2
EMISSION FORMULA:
The block reward in year t is defined as:
R(t) = R0 ç (
2
1
)
+t/4,
Where QBC is the initial reward. This function produces a halving every  years, similar to
Bitcoin but with a more generous start to establish early network security.
R0 = 50
EMISSION PROJECTION:
The following table details the annual emission and accumulated supply of QBC over the years,
reflecting the inverse logarithmic curve:
 ,, ,,
 ,, ,,
 , ,,
 , ,,
 , ,,
 , ,,
This curve creates structural upward pressure. As adoption grows (increasing demand) and
emission decreases (reducing supply), the price must adjust upwards to maintain market
equilibrium. Historically, Bitcoin has demonstrated this effect with precision: each halving has
preceded massive bull markets with delays of - months.
COMPARISON WITH GOLD:
Comparison with Gold: Gold mining production increases approximately .% annually.
QbitCoin, after the third halving, will have an inflation rate below %, making it the
hardest asset known to humanity.
Tokenomics I: Supply and
Programmed Scarcity - Part 1
Scarcity is the foundation of all monetary value. Gold is valuable not only for its industrial utility,
but because its abundance is limited by terrestrial geology. Bitcoin improved this concept by
introducing absolute mathematical scarcity: exactly  million units, not one more. QbitCoin
adopts this same philosophy, but with an emission curve designed to maximize long-term stability.
Our maximum supply is cryptographically encoded in the consensus protocol: ,, QBC.
This number is non-negotiable, cannot be inflated by governance voting, and is protected by the
same mathematical guarantees that secure transactions. Any attempt to modify the supply would
result in a hard fork that the community can reject by running the original implementation.
FUNDAMENTAL METRICS:

Total Supply
Absolute maximum of QBC that will ever exist.
Engraved in the genesis block.
100
Years of Emission

distributed through mining rewards.
0%
Final Inflation
Inflation rate once emission is complete.
Deflation through loss of private keys.
The emission policy follows an inverse logarithmic curve, designed to balance short-term
incentives (attracting miners) with long-term deflationary pressure (increasing scarcity).
Tokenomics II: The Halving and
Market Cycles - Part 2
ECONOMIC DYNAMICS OF HALVINGS:
Each halving represents a % reduction in supply inflation. This creates a 'staircase' effect on the price: periods of
consolidation followed by parabolic explosions. Historical analysis of Bitcoin shows that post-halving highs typically occur
 months after the event, enough time for the market to absorb the supply shock and readjust expectations.
Miner Dynamics
After each halving, less efficient miners are forced to
shut down their equipment due to negative margins.
This temporarily reduces the hashrate, increasing
profitability for the remaining miners. Difficulty
automatically adjusts every  blocks, restoring
balance.
Market Reaction
Traders anticipate halvings months in advance,
creating speculative buying pressure. This often
results in 'bull runs' that precede the halving, followed
by corrections, and finally a sustained rally based on
supply fundamentals.
STOCK-TO-FLOW RATIO:
The Stock-to-Flow (SF) ratio measures the relationship between existing stock and annual production. Assets with a high
SF (gold: , Bitcoin post-halving: ~) tend to maintain value better than commodities with a low SF. QbitCoin will reach
an SF of  in Era , surpassing gold as the planet's most scarce asset.
"Halvings are not price events; they are economic physics events. They alter the fundamental
incentive structure, and price is simply the adjustment mechanism."
Tokenomics II: The Halving and
Market Cycles - Part 1
The halving is the most important event in the QbitCoin economy. Every , blocks
(approximately  years), the mining reward is cut in half. This mechanism, inherited from Bitcoin,
creates a predictable supply shock that has shown statistical correlation with bullish market cycles.
However, QbitCoin introduces refinements that stabilize these cycles and reduce extreme volatility.
THE FIVE ERAS OF QBITCOIN:
Era 1: Genesis

Reward:  QBC/block
Total Issuance: .M QBC
Phase of institutional accumulation and
establishment of mining infrastructure.
Era 2: Growth

store of value. Price stabilization.
Era 4: Consolidation
-
Reward: . QBC/block
Total Issuance: .M QBC
Third halving. Inflation lower than gold.
Dominant monetary asset.
Tokenomics III: Reward Distribution - Part 2
In this second part of reward distribution, we will delve into the functioning of the DAO Treasury and Validator Staking, key
elements for the sustainability and decentralization of QbitCoin.
DAO Treasury
Funds cryptographically locked via decentralized
governance smart contracts. These resources finance
the long-term development of the protocol without
relying on external venture capital that could
compromise the project's independence.
On-chain voting by QBC holders
Full transparency through blockchain
Funding for security audits
Research in post-quantum cryptography
Grants for open-source developers
Funds are released through governance proposals that
require approval from % of active voters. This
prevents capture by coordinated minorities while
allowing adaptive evolution of the protocol.
Validator Staking
Passive reward for nodes that maintain the critical
network infrastructure: archivists, full nodes, and
high-speed relays. It does not require specialized
hardware, only capital locked as a guarantee of honest
behavior.
Annual yield: -% APY
Minimum staking period:  days
Slashing for malicious behavior
Delegation allowed for small holders
This hybrid PoW/PoS model combines the physical
security advantages of Proof-of-Work with the energy
efficiency and accessibility of Proof-of-Stake.
Validators act as a second line of defense, verifying
that miners do not produce invalid blocks.
100-YEAR PROJECTION:
Assuming a stable price, the DAO treasury will accumulate approximately .M QBC over the century of issuance. At
projected market values, this represents a multi-billion dollar development fund, ensuring continuous evolution even as
mining rewards approach zero.
Tokenomics III: Reward Distribution
- Part 1
An economic system is only as robust as its incentive alignment mechanisms. QbitCoin implements
a tripartite reward distribution designed to ensure network security, continuous development, and
operational decentralization for at least a century. This architecture avoids the incentive problems
that have plagued other projects: mining centralization, developer capture, and economic thermal
death.
TRIPARTITE REWARD DISTRIBUTION:
60% Mining Rewards
The majority of each block reward is allocated to miners who provide computational security
through RubikPoW. This ensures there is always a massive economic incentive to protect the
network against % attacks.
Distributed proportionally to work performed
Instant payments per block
No lock-up or vesting periods
Free market for mining hardware
This fraction ensures that the cost of attacking the network always exponentially exceeds the
potential benefit. An attacker would need to surpass % of the global hashrate, requiring
capital investment in hardware that would immediately depreciate after a successful attack
due to loss of trust.
Hybrid Cryptography: Dilithium Signatures
and the End of ECDSA - Part 2
IMPLEMENTATION IN QBITCOIN
Dilithium's implementation in QbitCoin uses security level  (equivalent to AES-), offering a security margin that will
remain robust even against unforeseen improvements in quantum algorithms. Each transaction signed with Dilithium
includes cryptographic proof that the sender possesses the corresponding private key, without revealing information about
said key.
TRANSITION FROM ECDSA
For users migrating from Bitcoin or other ECDSA blockchains, QbitCoin offers a secure transition
mechanism:
1 Dilithium key generation
Generation of a Dilithium key pair
2 Signing with old key
Signing the new public key with the old ECDSA key
3 On-chain broadcast
Broadcast of the on-chain transition
4 Grace period
-day grace period to complete migration
This process ensures that even if ECDSA keys are compromised in the future, migrated funds remain secure under Dilithium.
KYBER PROTOCOL FOR EXCHANGE
In addition to signatures, QbitCoin implements Cristals-Kyber to establish encrypted channels between nodes. Kyber is a
post-quantum KEM (Key Encapsulation Mechanism) that allows:
Secure symmetric
keys
Secure establishment of
symmetric keys
Perfect forward
secrecy
Perfect forward secrecy
Resistance to quantum
attacks
Resistance against quantum
Man-in-the-Middle attacks
Even if an adversary records network traffic today and develops a quantum computer in , they will not be able to
decrypt past communications.
The decision to implement Dilithium and Kyber from the genesis block (instead of as a future upgrade) eliminates decades
of technical debt and transition vulnerabilities. There will be no 'Q-Day' where QbitCoin must rush to patch quantum
vulnerabilities; quantum resistance is coded into the protocol's DNA.
Hybrid Cryptography: Dilithium
Signatures and the End of ECDSA -
Part 1
While RubikPoW ensures consensus and prevents double
spending, digital signatures secure ownership and
authorize transactions. In the current ecosystem, most
cryptocurrencies use ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital
Signature Algorithm), the same algorithm that protects
HTTPS communications and bank transactions. ECDSA is
elegant, efficient, and... doomed.
The fundamental problem with ECDSA is that its security
relies on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete
Logarithm Problem. This problem, like prime factorization,
falls to Shor's algorithm. Even worse, in ECDSA the public
key is mathematically derived from the private key by
point multiplication on the curve. A quantum computer
can reverse this operation.
QbitCoin breaks with this paradigm by natively implementing Crystals-Dilithium. Dilithium is a
lattice-based digital signature scheme, selected by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and
Technology) of the USA as a post-quantum cryptography standard in July . This is not a
speculative choice; it is the algorithm that will protect state secrets and military communications
against quantum adversaries.
FUNDAMENTALS OF DILITHIUM:
Underlying Problem
Module Learning With
Errors (MLWE): Finding an
exact solution to a system of
linear equations with added
noise. The lattice structure
makes this problem hard
even for quantum
algorithms.
Provable Security
Dilithium's security is
reduced to the MLWE
problem through rigorous
mathematical proofs.
Breaking Dilithium requires
solving problems for which
no efficient quantum
algorithm is known.
Practical Efficiency
Public key size: . KB.
Signature size: . KB.
Verification time: <ms.
These metrics are
comparable to ECDSA,
making the transition
practical.

incentives for the research community.

coordination between miners and validators. If the system survives these scenarios on the testnet, we have empirical
confidence in its robustness on the mainnet.

In cryptographic systems, trust is not requested: it is demonstrated through radical transparency
and public scrutiny. No amount of verbal assurances can substitute for independent audits
conducted by adversarial experts whose job is to break what we have built. QbitCoin implements a

stress tests under conditions that exceed any realistic attack scenario.

Final Vision: QbitCoin as PostQuantum Monetary Infrastructure -
Part 1
QbitCoin is not an incremental iteration on Bitcoin. It is not an 'altcoin' that adds marginal features
or adjusts consensus parameters. It is a fundamental reconstruction of digital monetary
architecture, designed from the ground up under the assumption that universal quantum
computing is not a distant possibility, but an imminent inevitability that will radically transform the
global cryptographic security landscape.
When the first scalable quantum computers emerge from research labs and begin to demonstrate
practical supremacy over cryptographic problems, an extinction event will occur in the blockchain
ecosystem. Systems based on ECDSA, RSA, and other classical primitives will see their security
guarantees instantly evaporate. Trillions of dollars in nominal value will become vulnerable bits,
waiting to be plundered by whoever possesses quantum technology.
QBITCOIN'S SECURITY PYRAMID:
QbitCoin is built upon an impregnable security structure, designed to withstand future threats. This
pyramid represents the fundamental layers that guarantee its resilience:
1
Global Financial Infrastructure
2 Transparent Decentralized Governance
3 Rigorous Deflationary Economy
4 Native Post-Quantum Cryptography
5 Absolute Physical Security
QbitCoin will be the refuge. When financial institutions and governments realize that their current
systems are obsolete, they will massively migrate capital towards the only infrastructure that offers
verifiable mathematical guarantees of quantum resistance. It will not be a gradual adoption
motivated by ideology; it will be a stampede for economic survival.
QbitCoin Part III:
DAO
Constitution and
Regulatory
Framework
Welcome to the legislative layer of QbitCoin. In
previous chapters, we established the physical
architecture (RubikPoW) and the data structure
(Quantum Ledger). Now, we turn to the most
critical layer for long-term survival: human
governance and integration into sovereign law.
QbitCoin does not operate in a legal vacuum. It
is a public infrastructure managed by the
QbitCoin Decentralized Autonomous
Organization (Q-DAO), designed to resist both
cryptographic attacks and regulatory or
corporate co-option. This document describes
the social and legal engineering that protects
the protocol.
1. Digital Sovereignty: Q-DAO
The biggest security flaw in first-generation cryptocurrencies is not cryptographic, but political.
Plutocracy (rule by the wealthy) allows large token holders ("whales") to hijack protocol development.
For an asset designed for the post-quantum era, this centralized attack vector is unacceptable.
The Problem: 1 Token = 1 Vote
In traditional systems, capital accumulation
directly correlates with the accumulation of
political power. This discourages
participation from the technical base and
facilitates hostile governance attacks by
competitors or nation-states.
The Solution: Quadratic Voting
We implement mathematical governance
where the cost of influence increases
exponentially. This dilutes the power of large
capital holders and protects the voice of the
scientific community.
The formula ensures that the marginal cost of each additional vote rises dramatically,
making election buying economically unfeasible.
Cost = (Votes)2




 Vote  Votes  Votes  Votes
Cost Analysis: As shown in the graph, a single
user can cast  vote for  QBC, while a "whale"
wishing to exert their will with  votes must pay
 times more. This mathematical mechanism
democratizes decision-making without
sacrificing economic security.
2. The Guardian Nodes
Although the network is inherently "trustless", the latency of a full DAO vote can be fatal in the event of
a "zero-day exploit" threat. We need a rapid defense mechanism, a technical vanguard that can react
in milliseconds.

A rotating body of  Level 
validators
(military/scientific). They
are not politicians, but elite
security engineers.
Algorithmic Election
The election is conducted
automatically via Smart
Contracts, strictly based on
technical reputation metrics
and uptime, eliminating
human lobbying.
Restricted Powers
They cannot seize funds or
censor transactions. Their
sole authority is to propose
an immediate "defensive
hard fork" in the event of a
confirmed quantum
cryptographic breach.
3. Regulatory Compliance: European
Union (MiCA)
QbitCoin was designed from the ground up (compliance-by-design) to meet the MiCA regulation, the
world's most demanding regulatory standard.
1
Transparency (Art. 4-15)
This technical whitepaper fully complies with
the requirements for transparency, risk
description, and disclosure of the underlying
technology, as mandated by European
legislation.
2
ESG Sustainability
Unlike Bitcoin's energy waste, the heat
generated by RubikPoW is classified as
"Useful Computation." We are forging
alliances to integrate miners' waste heat into
district heating networks, thereby aligning
with the goals of the European Green Deal.
4. Regulatory Compliance: United States (SEC & CFTC)
For institutional investors and the American market, it is essential to clarify the legal nature of the
asset. QbitCoin voluntarily undergoes analysis according to the Howey Test.
Investment of Money: YES
There are concrete economic costs associated
with mining and acquiring the asset.
Common Enterprise: NO
The network is decentralized and leaderless.
There is no central entity collecting or
managing investor funds.
Expectation of Profits: MARKET
Value is derived from the free forces of supply
and demand, not from contractual promises
of a promotor or management team.
Efforts of Third Parties: NO
Success depends on intrinsic mathematical
security and global acceptance, not on the
work of a specific management team.
Legal Conclusion: Based on this analysis, QbitCoin is classified as a COMMODITY (Digital
Good), similar to gold or oil, and not a Security. This falls under the jurisdiction of the CFTC
and outside the SEC's enforcement actions against unregistered securities.
5. Institutional Risk Management
Full transparency is a pillar of QbitCoin. We present our risk report for family offices and sovereign
wealth funds, detailing not only the opportunities but also the existential threats and their
countermeasures.
Technological Risk
Threat: A critical error in the
implementation of the post-quantum
Dilithium algorithm.
Mitigation: Crypto-Agility. The network
architecture allows the DAO to coordinate
an emergency migration to alternative
algorithms such as FALCON or SPHINCS+
"on the fly" without stopping the
blockchain, thus ensuring operational
continuity.
Market Risk
Threat: Extreme volatility during the initial
price discovery phases.
Mitigation: Strict Vesting. The funds of the
DAO treasury (% of the supply) are
technically locked for  years. This
prevents mass selling (dumping) by the
founding developers and aligns incentives
for the long term.
6. Schrödinger Security Fund
Security is not just prevention, but also recovery. We have established the Schrödinger Fund, a
decentralized, automated insurance mechanism within the protocol.
% of each block reward is automatically redirected to a
public multisig wallet (vault.qbitcoin.eth). This
accumulated capital serves as an insurance policy against
technical disasters.
Purpose: Compensation for users in the unlikely event
of critical protocol errors leading to loss of funds during
the beta phase ( months).
Access Management: The fund is a digital fortress.
Every movement requires the cryptographic signature
of  out of  guardians.
Time-Lock: Even with signatures, there is a mandatory
-hour waiting period, visible on the blockchain,
before funds can be moved, to allow the community to
audit the transaction.
10%
Block Reward
Automatic allocation to the reserve fund.
75%
Required Consensus
 out of  guardians to approve withdrawals.
24m
Beta Phase Duration
Critical insurance coverage period.
7. Interoperability and Bridges
Isolationism is the death of utility. QbitCoin is not designed as an island, but as the central reserve
bank of the metaverse, connected to the current financial ecosystem.
Wrapped QBC (wQBC)
An ERC- mirror token on the Ethereum
network. This allows QbitCoin's liquidity to
flow into established DeFi (Decentralized
Finance) protocols such as Uniswap or Aave,
enabling lending and yield without
compromising the security of the main chain.
Atomic Swaps
Technology for cross-chain exchange without
intermediaries. Allows direct exchange of
Bitcoin to QbitCoin without going through
centralized exchanges (CEX), ensuring full
privacy, censorship resistance, and elimination
of counterparty risk.
8. Strategic Alliances and Institutional Roadmap
Our roadmap extends beyond the code; it encompasses the physical infrastructure and human capital
necessary to sustain a post-quantum economy.
Hardware Sector
We are in active
negotiations with leading
silicon foundries (such as
TSMC) for the design and
production of specific ASIC
chips. These chips are
optimized for group
symmetry permutations,
which are essential for the
efficiency of the RubikPoW
algorithm at scale.
Academic Sector
Introduction of the "Alan
Turing" research grants. We
fund PhD students in
cryptography and
mathematics to
continuously review and
improve the efficiency and
security of the protocol.
Defense Sector
Deployment of private pilots
utilizing the K sidechain.
Their purpose is the
immutable traceability of
sensitive materials in
critical supply chains,
demonstrating QbitCoin's
industrial utility.
Foundation's Concluding Statement
"We did not build QbitCoin to compete with banks, but to offer a mathematical alternative when
quantum physics breaks down current locks. QbitCoin is the emergency plan for the digital
economy."
QbitCoin represents the definitive fusion of state security, the agility of free software, and institutional
robustness. It is more than a currency; it is an ark of security for value in an uncertain future.
Legal and Technical Glossary
DAO: Decentralized Autonomous Organization.
Commodity: Fungible basic good (like gold) used in trade.
Hard Fork: Radical protocol change incompatible with previous versions.
Vesting: Lock-up period during which tokens cannot be sold.

Projection
The project's sustainability is based on efficient management of seed capital and technology grants
(equity-free funding) available through European instruments such as the EIC Accelerator. The
operating budget (OPEX) is structured into six main categories, with conservative forecasts assuming
an annual salary inflation of -% in the European tech sector.

The financial model foresees three clearly defined funding phases, each aligned with verifiable
technical milestones (TRL - Technology Readiness Level).
Operational Budget Distribution
The visual analysis of budget distribution reveals QbitCoin Labs' strategic priorities. The massive
investment in human capital (more than % of OPEX) reflects the deep-tech nature of the project,
where the competitive advantage lies in the specialized knowledge of the team rather than operational
economies of scale.

the campaign for institutional adoption in
regulated markets.
The emergency fund continues to account for

risks and volatility in the technical talent
market.
Funding Strategy and Runway
QbitCoin Labs' funding strategy is structured into three clearly defined phases, each aligned with
verifiable technical milestones to progressively reduce execution risk for institutional investors and
European public bodies.
Phase 1: Seed + EIC
Seed round of - million
Euros combined with an
application for the EIC
Accelerator (. million Euro
grant + . million Euro
optional equity). Goal:
Achieve TRL - with a
functional testnet and
completed initial security
audits.
Phase 2: Series A
- million Euros from
European deep-tech funds
(Lakestar, Atomico, EQT
Ventures). Goal: Achieve TRL
 with a deployed mainnet,
initial institutional pilot
clients, and validated
European cryptography
certification.
Phase 3: Expansion
- million Euros for
international scaling,
development of derivative
products (Enterprise SDK,
regulated custody solutions),
and expansion of the team to
over  full-time
equivalents. Goal:
sustainable operational
profitability.
Treasury Management and Funding
Model
Treasury Management in Digital Assets
A portion of the company's liquidity (-%) will be held in regulated stablecoins and
highly liquid digital assets, enabling operational flexibility and partial hedging against Euro
volatility. This strategy generates passive income, contributing to the extension of the
operational runway without exerting downward pressure on the native token.
The hybrid funding model (equity + grants) is crucial for maintaining the project's technological
independence. The non-dilutive grants from the EIC Accelerator and other Horizon Europe programs
allow a larger percentage of company equity to be retained for the founding team and key employees,
thereby creating long-term incentives and reducing pressure for premature exits that could jeopardize
the original technical vision.
With the proposed funding structure, QbitCoin Labs has a secured -month runway to achieve the
Mainnet and technological maturity required for generating recurring revenue through licenses and
enterprise services.
Incentive Policy and Talent Retention
In the global competition for crypto and distributed systems talent, competitive salaries are necessary
but not sufficient. QbitCoin Labs implements a long-term incentive system that turns key employees
into true owners of the project, aligning individual interests with the collective success of the
company.
Employee Stock Option Program
(ESOP) & Tokens
% of the total equity of the GmbH and % of the
native token supply are reserved for the Employee
Stock Option Pool (ESOP). This dual structure enables
value creation from both the growth of the traditional
company and the appreciation of the digital asset.
The vesting schedule follows the industry standard
for the technology sector:  years vesting with a -
year cliff. If an employee leaves the company before
the first year, they receive no options. After the cliff,
options are released monthly on a linear basis.
Founding employees (the first  hires) additionally
receive an Early-Bird Bonus: a .x multiplier on the
standard option allocation for their seniority level.

QbitCoin Part V: Scientific
Benchmarks, Topology, and Quantum
Resistance
Technical report on performance, thermodynamic efficiency, and cryptographic security in the postquantum era.
This document describes the results achieved in the development laboratory Qbit-Labs. The
presented data confirms the technical superiority of the proposed architecture over existing Layer 
protocols.
1. Methodology and Test
Environment
To ensure the scientific integrity of the results, stress tests were conducted in the "Heisenberg" testnet,
which was designed to simulate hostile network conditions and high overload.
Distributed Infrastructure
Network of  simulated nodes deployed on
AWS EC (c.large) instances and
geographically distributed to replicate real
decentralization.
Network Conditions
Bandwidth limited to  Mbit/s per node,
with an artificial latency of  ms simulating
transatlantic delays.
Massive Load
Continuous injection of  million
simultaneous transactions to measure the
mempool's breaking point.
Target KPIs
Precise measurement of TPS (Transactions
Per Second), TTF (Time To Finality), and
energy consumption in Joules.
2. Comparative Analysis: The
Trilemma Solved
Benchmarks confirm that QbitCoin overcomes the structural limitations of the Blockchain Trilemma
(Scalability, Security, Decentralization). The critical performance comparison is presented below.

3. Speed Analysis (DAG Tier 1)
For user-level transactions (Tier K), QbitCoin implements
a cryptographically anchored Directed Acyclic Graph
(DAG) structure. Unlike linear blockchains, where blocks
form a single line, the DAG allows for parallel validation.
True Parallelism: Multiple transactions confirm each
other without having to wait for a global block.
Positive Linear Scalability: Paradoxically, validation
becomes faster and more secure the more users
operate on the network.
Adaptability: Block size is dynamic (K-K) and adapts
to demand in real-time.
4. Thermodynamic Efficiency: "Green
Blockchain"
Sustainability is not an option, but a mathematical necessity. QbitCoin drastically reduces energy costs
by changing the nature of the cryptographic problem.
3M J
Bitcoin / Tx
Equivalent to . million VISA
transactions.
100 J
Ethereum / Tx
Significant improvement, but
insufficient for IoT.
0.02 J
QbitCoin / Tx
Near-perfect thermodynamic
efficiency.
Critical Fact: Bitcoin's annual energy consumption ($ TWh$) exceeds that of entire
countries like Argentina. QbitCoin eliminates this thermal waste.
5. The Secret: Asymmetric
Verification ($P \neq NP$)
The key to our efficiency lies in the **RubikPoW** algorithm, which leverages the computational
asymmetry between generating a solution and verifying it.
Mining (Difficult)
Finding the shortest path in
the n-dimensional cube is
an **NP-hard** problem
with factorial complexity. It
requires specialized
hardware.
Verifying (Trivial)
Checking whether the
proposed path solves the
cube is a simple polynomial
operation ($O()$). It is
instant and easy.
IoT Implications
A  smartphone can
validate the entire network
without draining its battery,
enabling massive, real
decentralization.
6. Network Topology: From Plane to
Hypercube
While Bitcoin is a one-dimensional chain vulnerable to hash rate centralization, QbitCoin is an ndimensional geometric structure.
Dimensions of the Hypercube
Ledger
Dimensión  (Time): Immutable
chronological order.
Dimensión  (Shards): Distributed
fragmentation.
Dimensión  (State): Configuration of the
cryptographic Rubik's Cube.
Dimensión  (Security): Lattice encryption
layers.
This topology makes a "% attack"
geometrically impossible, as it would require
instantaneous coordination that would violate
the speed of light.
7. War Gaming: Simulating Quantum
Attacks
Mathematical modeling of resilience against an adversary with a universal quantum computer (
logical qubits).
Scenario A: Attack on Consensus
(Grover)
Grover attempts to solve the cube through
quantum brute-force. The state space of the
x cube is $. \times ^{}$. Grover
only reduces this to $^{}$ operations.
Performing such a calculation would require
more energy than a supernova. The network
is thermodynamically secure.
Scenario B: Attack on Keys (Shor)
Shor breaks RSA by factoring integers.
QbitCoin uses Cristals-Dilithium signatures,
which are based on lattices. Lattices do not
have the cyclic structure that Shor exploits.
The quantum attacker only perceives random
vectorial noise. The funds are unreachable.
8. Hardware and Scientific Mining
QbitCoin professionalizes mining by transforming it into "Proof-of-Useful-Work" (PoUW), where energy
consumption creates added value for humanity.
Validator Node Specifications
CPU AVX-512
AMD EPYC / Intel Xeon
64 GB RAM
DDR ECC
4 TB NVMe
SSD Gen
1 Gbit/s
Symmetric Fiber Optic
In Phase , permutation calculations will be used to solve problems of protein folding and to optimize
neural networks for AI.
9. Scientific Conclusion
QbitCoin represents a quantum leap in applied
computer science. It is not simply an
incremental improvement over Bitcoin; it is a
fundamental redefinition of the rules of
consensus.
We have succeeded in decoupling security
from energy consumption and cryptography
from the quantum threat. Mathematical
proofs position QbitCoin as the only Layer-
protocol that will survive intact beyond the
year .
QbitCoin Part VI: Strategic Analysis
and Horizon 2035
In this definitive chapter, we present a comprehensive strategic analysis that positions QbitCoin as
Europe's sovereign answer to the imminent quantum threat. This document is designed for
government institutions, European regulators, and strategic investors who understand that the next
decade will redefine global financial infrastructure. Radical transparency is our philosophy: we will
expose both our absolute strengths and the weaknesses we are actively mitigating. We do not seek
short-term speculation; we are building the critical infrastructure that will protect the digital wealth of
future generations.
The arrival of "Q-Day" 4the moment quantum computers will break RSA and ECDSA4 is not a
question of if it will happen, but when. While Bitcoin and Ethereum represent innovations of the past,
QbitCoin embodies the vision of the post-quantum future. This strategic analysis reveals how our
unique architecture based on Permutation Groups and NIST post-quantum cryptography makes us
the only protocol prepared for the coming era.
S48
SWOT Analysis: The Strategic Truth
Transparency is the foundation of institutional trust. We present a comprehensive SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,
Threats) analysis that reveals our true competitive position, free from inflated marketing or empty promises. This strategic
framework identifies our differentiated internal capabilities, the massive market opportunities opening up before us, the
operational weaknesses we are actively correcting, and the regulatory and technological threats we constantly monitor.
This analysis serves as the basis for our R&D investment decisions, strategic alliances, and geographical expansion. Each
quadrant has been evaluated by our steering committee in Frankfurt and validated by independent advisors in cybersecurity,
European financial regulation, and blockchain technology. The brutal honesty in this analysis demonstrates the organizational
maturity of QbitCoin Labs GmbH and our ability to execute long-term strategy in complex and highly regulated markets.
STRENGTHS
European Sovereign Technology: Unique protocol
based on Permutation Groups , completely
independent of US or Asian technology. Guarantees
total digital sovereignty for the European Union.
S48
World-Class Elite Team: Exceptional fusion of academic
cryptographers with publications in Tier- conferences
(CRYPTO, EUROCRYPT) and core developers with +
years in Rust/C++ for critical systems.
Armored Legal Structure: German GmbH with full
registration in Frankfurt am Main, offering maximum
intellectual property guarantees under European
legislation and MiCA regulatory compliance by design.
OPPORTUNITIES
The Inevitable "Q-Day": The advent of practical
quantum computing (estimated -) will trigger
explosive demand for quantum-resistant cryptographic
infrastructure. A - year window to capture the market.
MiCA Regulation as a Catalyst: QbitCoin is built to
comply with Markets in Crypto-Assets from its core
architecture, enabling direct banking integration in all
 EU member states without legal friction.
Current Technology Vacuum: No existing Tier-
blockchain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana) has a credible
post-quantum migration plan. We capture the entire
European institutional market seeking guaranteed
security.
WEAKNESSES
Limited Initial Network Effect: As a new protocol, we
start with a smaller user base than Bitcoin (M+
users). Active Mitigation: Aggressive economic
incentives for European validators (x rewards for the
first  months).
Specific Hardware Barrier: Permutation-based mining
requires CPUs with AVX- instructions, not generic
GPUs. Active Mitigation: Confirmed alliances with
Infineon Technologies and STMicroelectronics for
optimized QbitCoin-ASIC chips produced in Europe.
Perceived Cryptographic Complexity: Technical
learning curve for developers accustomed to simple
ECDSA. Active Mitigation: SDKs in  languages (Python,
JavaScript, Rust, Go, Java, C++, Swift, Kotlin) with
exhaustive documentation and Certification Academies.
THREATS
Regulatory Resistance in Non-EU Markets: Legal
uncertainty in jurisdictions such as the United States
(undefined SEC) or China (variable prohibitions).
Strategic Response: Total focus on Europe and clear
regulated markets (Switzerland, Singapore, United Arab
Emirates).
Competition from Tech Giants: Google, IBM, or
Amazon could launch their own post-quantum
blockchains with massive resources. Strategic Response:
First-mover advantage (-year head start) and exclusive
specialization vs. generalist conglomerates.
Technological "Black Swan" Events: Unexpected

critical vulnerability in Dilithium/Kyber. Strategic
Response: Omega Emergency Migration Protocol (see
Section ).
Vision 2035: The New Digital Gold
Standard
Our strategic vision is not measured in quarters or - year market cycles. QbitCoin is designed to
become critical infrastructure that operates for decades, comparable to the role physical gold played
for centuries as a universal store of value. While speculative cryptocurrencies seek quick profits, we are
building the foundations of the post-quantum financial system that will sustain Europe's digital
economy in the st century.
By , we project that QbitCoin will have evolved from an experimental protocol to become the de
facto standard for high-value transactions requiring absolute mathematical security guarantees.
European central banks will maintain strategic reserves in QBC as a hedge against the cryptographic
obsolescence of their legacy systems. Multinational corporations will use our Layer  DAG protocol for
instant cross-border settlements without banking intermediaries charging -% fees.
Institutional Strategic
Reserve
EU financial institutions use
QbitCoin as a hedging asset
against cryptographic
obsolescence. The ECB
recommends holding -% of
digital reserves in certified postquantum protocols.
Sovereign Digital
Identity
Full integration with European
identity initiatives (eIDAS .),
protecting the credentials of
 million citizens using
quantum-resistant Dilithium
Level  signatures.
Secure Industry 4.0
Industrial IoT devices in smart
factories perform machine-tomachine micropayments using
our DAG protocol, processing
, transactions/second
with sub-ms latency and
guaranteed post-quantum
security.
Infrastructure of the Future: Europe
Leads
The architecture of QbitCoin transcends the traditional concept of "cryptocurrency" to become a
critical infrastructure protocol comparable to TCP/IP or HTTPS. Our vision for  contemplates three
fundamental pillars that will transform the European digital economy, positioning the continent as a
global leader in the post-quantum transition while the United States and Asia struggle to update their
vulnerable legacy systems.
Integration with National Systems
The governments of Germany, France, the Netherlands,
and Italy are already evaluating QbitCoin for pilot projects
of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Our protocol
complies with all European Banking Authority (EBA)
requirements for critical financial infrastructure: .%
availability, full traceability for anti-money laundering
compliance, and regulatory intervention capability without
compromising the technical decentralization of consensus.
The fundamental competitive advantage is that QbitCoin
was designed from the ground up to operate in highly
regulated environments. While Bitcoin and Ethereum
struggle to adapt to MiCA through patches and secondary
layers, our native architecture includes functionalities such
as:
Optional KYC identification at the wallet level (without
compromising transactional privacy)
Controlled reversibility for judicially confirmed fraud
cases
Real-time auditing for tax authorities without revealing
private data
Native interoperability with SEPA and TARGET systems
of the ECB
"European technological
sovereignty demands that we
build our own financial
infrastructure resilient to
quantum threats. QbitCoin
represents exactly the kind of
strategic innovation that the
European Commission must
actively support."

Projected Adoption Metrics 2025-
2035
Based on validated technology adoption models (Rogers' S-curve) and historical data from Bitcoin
(-) and Ethereum (-), we have constructed conservative growth projections for
QbitCoin. These numbers assume realistic market penetration scenarios, without positive "black
swan" events such as accelerated governmental adoption or the collapse of legacy blockchain due to a
premature quantum attack.

Active Users (Millions) Network Value (Billions ¬) Daily Transactions (Millions)
The critical inflection point occurs in -, when the first quantum computer with + stable
qubits demonstrates the ability to break RSA- in practical time. At that moment, global financial
institutions will initiate a massive migration towards post-quantum infrastructure, and QbitCoin will
capture -% of the European market as the only mature and battle-tested protocol. This
accelerated transition explains the projected exponential growth in the - phase, where users
and network value multiply by x and .x respectively.
"Black Swan" Emergency Protocol
The management of existential risks is a fundamental responsibility of any critical infrastructure. We
have designed the Omega Emergency Protocol, a contingency plan activable in case quantum
computing advances faster than projected by current roadmaps (IBM, Google, IonQ). If a state actor or
corporation demonstrates the ability to break Dilithium Level  before , QbitCoin Labs GmbH will
activate this three-phase protocol designed to protect all assets on the network without loss of funds.
Phase 1: Immediate
Hard Fork (T+0 to
T+48h)
Forced migration of all network
nodes to Level K (Maximum
Military Security), using -bit
cryptographic parameters that
require ^ operations to break
4 physically impossible even with
quantum computers of millions of
qubits. This update increases the
signature size from .KB to .KB
and reduces throughput by %,
but guarantees absolute
invulnerability.
The hard fork is executed through
an automatic software update
signed by the  master keys of the
emergency committee (/
threshold), geographically
distributed in bank vaults in
Switzerland, Germany, France,
Sweden, and the Netherlands.
Nodes that do not update within
h are automatically expelled
from consensus to prevent network
partition attacks.
Phase 2: Bridge
Isolation (T+48h to
T+7d)
Temporary disconnection of all
interoperability bridges with
vulnerable blockchains (Bitcoin,
Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain,
Solana). This quarantine measure
protects QbitCoin's financial core
while external protocols are
potentially compromised by
quantum attacks. Assets locked in
bridges are frozen via emergency
smart contracts until external
chains complete their own postquantum migrations.
Simultaneously, we activate
economic survival mode:
validator rewards are temporarily
doubled to incentivize
participation during periods of
uncertainty, and transaction fees
are reduced to the absolute
minimum to facilitate fund
movement for affected users.
Phase 3:
Coordinated Rapid
Response (T+7d to
T+30d)
Deployment of coordinated
security patches from Frankfurt
HQ, with rapid response teams
operating / in three global
shifts. We establish direct
communication with: () The
European Union Agency for
Cybersecurity (ENISA), () Member
State Ministries of Defense, ()
Major European exchanges
(Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitpanda), and
() Institutional custody service
providers.
We publish full transparency
through daily reports on network
status, protected funds, and
migration progress. Trust is
maintained through live audits by
independent security firms (Trail of
Bits, NCC Group, Kudelski
Security). By the end of  days,
QbitCoin emerges as the only
protocol to have survived "Q-Day"
intact, solidifying its position as
trusted critical infrastructure.
Strategic Comparison: QbitCoin vs.
Competition
To objectively position our value proposition, we present a technical and strategic comparative

QbitCoin's competitive advantage is clear: we are the only protocol that combines native postquantum security, high throughput via DAG architecture, European regulatory compliance by design,
and support from a solid legal structure in Europe's most stable jurisdiction. Bitcoin and Ethereum are
legacy technologies destined for obsolescence; QRL and Cellframe are experimental projects lacking
institutional maturity. QbitCoin occupies the optimal strategic space.
Call to Action: The Post-Quantum Era
History is Divided into Eras
For centuries, gold was the universal standard of value, backed by its physical scarcity and resistance to degradation. In ,
the Bretton Woods system collapsed, and fiat currencies were born, backed solely by trust in governments. In , Satoshi
Nakamoto launched Bitcoin, demonstrating that mathematical consensus could create digital scarcity without central authority.
Today, in , we find ourselves on the eve of the fourth era: the Post-Quantum Era.
Current blockchains are sandcastles built on the beach, awaiting the inevitable high tide of quantum computing. They are
beautiful structures, admirable in their mathematical elegance, but fundamentally vulnerable. Bitcoin and Ethereum represent
innovations of the past that will soon be historical relics, as obsolete as telegraph systems were before the advent of the
Internet. QbitCoin is the reinforced concrete bunker built on the mountain, designed to withstand the coming quantum tsunami.
To Strategic Investors
The early entry window closes with the Genesis Block in
March . The first institutional investors who understand
the magnitude of this technological transition will capture
historical returns comparable to those who invested in the
Internet in  or Bitcoin in . This is not about
speculation; it is about critical infrastructure that will
generate value for decades.
Q-Day is not a conspiracy theory of delusional futurists. IBM
has published technical roadmaps showing + qubit
systems by . Google demonstrated "quantum
supremacy" in  with just  qubits. The progression is
exponential, and the time to prepare is now, not when the
alarms sound and it's too late.
To Developers and Innovators
Help us build the cryptographic shield that will protect
humanity's digital wealth. We are looking for exceptional
talents in cryptography, distributed systems, protocol
development, and network architecture. QbitCoin is not just
an open-source project; it is a mission to preserve financial
freedom in the quantum era.
Our codebase in Rust and C++ is designed to be studied,
audited, and improved by the global community. We publish
peer-reviewed academic research, contribute to NIST
standards, and collaborate with leading universities (TU
Munich, ETH Zurich, MIT). Join the technological vanguard
that will define the next three decades.
Europe Leads: The Time is Now
Let's Not Be Late This Time
Europe lost leadership in the internet revolution 4 dominated by Silicon Valley. We lost leadership in social media 4 dominated
by Facebook, Twitter, TikTok. We lost leadership in first-generation blockchain 4 Bitcoin and Ethereum are American projects or
lack clear jurisdiction. But history offers us an opportunity for redemption: we can lead the post-quantum transition.
QbitCoin is profoundly European technology: founded in Germany under strict regulation, developed by teams in Frankfurt,
Munich, Zurich, and Amsterdam, audited by European cybersecurity firms, and designed to comply with MiCA from the first byte
of code. While the United States debates fragmented state-by-state regulation, and China oscillates between prohibitions and
controlled experiments, Europe has a - year window to establish the global standard for post-quantum financial
infrastructure.
