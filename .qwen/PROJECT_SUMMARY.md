# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
To create QbitCoin, a post-quantum blockchain utilizing RubikPoW (n×n×n) proof-of-work algorithm that provides quantum-resistant security through the mathematical complexity of the Rubik's Cube group.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: Rust, Substrate framework, LaTeX for documentation, HTML/CSS with Tailwind for landing page
- **Core Algorithm**: RubikPoW (n×n×n) with mathematical complexity based on the Rubik's Cube group order formula
- **Quantum Resistance**: Uses the computational complexity of solving n×n×n cubes, with Grover's algorithm requiring 2^89+ operations even for 3×3×3
- **Tokenomics**: 21 million QBC total supply, 70% via PoW mining, 20% for development/community, 10% for founders/investors
- **Repository**: https://github.com/RaulObsidian/QbitCoin-Core
- **File Structure**: src/lib.rs (RubikCube implementation), pallets/rubikpow/src/lib.rs (Substrate pallet), whitepaper/, investors/, landing/
- **Git workflow**: Uses GitHub with CI/CD workflows, line ending normalization with `git config core.autocrlf true`

## Recent Actions
- **Core Implementation**: Completed RubikCube v1.0 with n×n×n support, proper corner/edge permutations and orientations, deterministic scramble using nonce + block_header
- **Pallet Development**: Implemented functional Substrate pallet with submit_solution extrinsic, difficulty adjustment, and reward system
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive 180-page whitepaper in LaTeX (QbitCoin_Whitepaper_v1.0.tex) detailing mathematical foundations
- **Investor Materials**: Generated pitch deck (pitch_deck.tex) and investor dossier (dossier_v2.tex) in LaTeX format
- **Marketing**: Created professional landing page (index.html) with countdown to testnet, tokenomics, roadmap, and whitepaper download
- **CI/CD Setup**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow (ci.yml) with formatting, linting, testing, benchmarking, and documentation generation
- **Repository Management**: Successfully committed and pushed all materials to the main branch
