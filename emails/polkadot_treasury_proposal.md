# Treasury Proposal: QbitCoin - Quantum-Resistant Blockchain via RubikPoW

## Proposal Summary

We are seeking funding for QbitCoin, a revolutionary quantum-resistant blockchain that uses RubikPoW (n×n×n Rubik's Cube group-based proof-of-work) to provide long-term security against quantum computing threats.

## Project Overview

QbitCoin (QBC) represents a breakthrough in cryptographic security by implementing RubikPoW, a proof-of-work algorithm based on the mathematical complexity of the Rubik's Cube group. This approach provides inherent quantum resistance through group theory problems that are difficult even for quantum computers to solve efficiently.

## Technical Innovation

Our core innovation lies in utilizing the computational complexity of the Rubik's Cube group, which has been shown to resist efficient quantum algorithms. The security is based on the discrete logarithm problem in permutation groups, for which no efficient quantum solutions exist like Shor's algorithm for number theory problems.

## Requested Amount

We are requesting 10,000,000 DOT to fund the development and deployment of the QbitCoin network, including:
- Core protocol development and security audits
- Substrate-based parachain integration
- Testnet deployment and mainnet launch
- Team expansion and operations for 24 months

## Team

Our team has extensive experience in cryptography, blockchain development, and quantum computing theory. We have already developed a functional proof-of-concept and comprehensive whitepaper detailing our approach.

## Timeline

- Q1 2026: Public testnet launch
- Q2 2026: Mainnet genesis
- Q4 2026: Smart contract integration
- Q2 2027: Scalability enhancements

## Community Impact

QbitCoin addresses a critical infrastructure vulnerability: the quantum computing threat to existing blockchains. By funding this project, the Polkadot community will have access to the first quantum-resistant blockchain technology, ensuring long-term security for the ecosystem.
