Subject: QbitCoin (QBC) - First Quantum-Resistant Blockchain via RubikPoW | Investment Opportunity

Dear [VC Name],

I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to introduce QbitCoin (QBC), the world's first quantum-resistant blockchain that addresses the critical security threat quantum computing poses to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

**The Problem**: Experts estimate that quantum computers will break Bitcoin and Ethereum's cryptographic security between 2030-2040, putting over $1 trillion in digital assets at risk. Current "quantum-resistant" solutions are add-ons that don't address the fundamental vulnerability.

**Our Solution**: QbitCoin uses RubikPoW, a revolutionary proof-of-work algorithm based on the mathematical complexity of the Rubik's Cube group. This provides quantum resistance by mathematical design, not add-on patches. Even with Grover's algorithm, solving our cube-based challenges requires 2^89 operations.

**Market Opportunity**: With quantum computers advancing faster than expected, the market for truly quantum-resistant blockchain infrastructure is estimated at $100+ billion by 2035.

**Current Status**: 
- Complete technical implementation
- 180-page whitepaper with mathematical foundations
- Investor pitch decks and dossiers (ES/EN/DE)
- Professional landing page with i18n
- Functional proof-of-concept

**Team**: Led by experienced blockchain and cryptography researchers with peer-reviewed publications in security.

**Funding Request**: Raising $5M Series A for team expansion, security audits, and mainnet launch.

We would welcome the opportunity to present our technology to your team. The quantum threat to crypto is real and approaching fast - but QbitCoin offers a fundamental, not incremental, solution.

Best regards,

P.S. The testnet launches Q2 2026. Early investors will have significant position before the quantum-resistance narrative becomes urgent for the market.
