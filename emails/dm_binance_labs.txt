Hi @BinanceLabs, I've developed QbitCoin (QBC) - the first quantum-resistant blockchain using RubikPoW algorithm. Unlike current chains, our approach is mathematically quantum-safe using Rubik's Cube group theory. 

We've built a working prototype, comprehensive whitepaper, and Next.js landing with i18n. Seeking strategic partners to secure the post-quantum crypto ecosystem. Could we schedule a brief call to discuss potential collaboration?

The quantum threat to existing blockchains is real and approaching (est. 2030-2040). QbitCoin offers the first fundamental solution rather than add-on security. Would love to show you our technical implementation.
